I am Yifei Zhu, a researcher and educator based at the City College of Huizhou, China. I hold a Master's degree in Radio and Television Planning and Production from the Communication University of China, and I am passionate about cultural studies, fan studies, BL web novels, comics/radio dramas, gender and sexuality, with a particular focus on Chinese and Asian media. My academic work includes several published articles and book chapters, where I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and media production. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Chinese Language and Culture with honors, along with a minor in Accounting from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies. Currently, I am furthering my education in new economy leadership at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School. 
In my professional journey, I have significantly contributed to queer media as the general manager of Shenzhen Yiming Culture Communication Co., where I managed a large following across social media platforms and produced content aimed at queer fangirls audiences. I have also worked in video operations and as a trainee director for various television programs. 

As an educator, I teach courses in digital media marketing, video production, and creative design, focusing on innovative teaching methods to enhance student engagement. I actively participate in community-building projects and have volunteered for various cultural and artistic initiatives. 
My work reflects my commitment to exploring cultural narratives and fostering inclusive communities through media. With skills in digital content creation, research, and education, I strive to make a positive impact in my field.
